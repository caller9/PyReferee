Usage:
python pyreferee.py

Configuration:
The config/servers.cfg file lists servers and channels to join on those servers.

The config/default_channel.cfg is the base config for any channel listed in servers.cfg. It will be used to create [servername][channe].cfg files
which can be customized to the channel in question. Or you can just manually copy or create [servername][channel].cfg files. Though
this is not recommended because you could omit vital information.
